All passengers arriving in Dubai from any destination, including passengers connecting in Dubai, must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate to be accepted on the flight. 

We recommend you bring a printed certificate, but digital ones are accepted in Dubai. It must be an official certificate - SMS confirmation messages are not accepted. 

The test must be taken a maximum of 96 hours before departure. This excludes children under the age of 12 and passengers who have a moderate or severe disability.

Children under 12 and people with mild and severe disabilities are exempt from COVID-19 PCR testing. This may vary by destination – always check before you fly.
