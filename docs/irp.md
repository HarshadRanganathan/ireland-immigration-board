### Travel

#### **1. I don’t need to register until I have been in the State for 90 days – what if I want to travel and return to Ireland before I register and receive my IRP card?**

If you know that you will be travelling within the first four months of your arrival in Ireland, you
should apply for a multiple entry visa for your initial trip to Ireland. This will enable you to travel in
and out of Ireland before you register and receive your IRP card.

If you travelled to Ireland on a single entry visa and discover that you need to travel and return to
Ireland before you get your IRP card, you can travel and apply for another entry visa from outside Ireland.

#### **2. I have registered for IRP but haven't received my card yet. Can I travel in and out of Ireland before I receive my IRP card?**

The Irish Residence Permit is issued to non-EEA nationals who have permission to reside in the State for more than 90 days. 

It can take some weeks to get a registration appointment, and up to 2 weeks for an IRP card to be produced following registration. 

Visa required nationals who intend to travel in and out of Ireland during the first four months of their planned stay should apply for a multiple entry visa, which will allow them to travel into Ireland multiple times in a given period before their IRP card is issued.
