## First Time Registration

### Appointment

#### **How do I get an appointment for first-time registration?**

The Dublin area Registration Office located in Burgh Quay will close temporarily, to allow for revised public health guidance to be issued. Further announcement in relation to the operation of the Registration Office will issue before the end of this week.

Please also note that all Registration Offices for non-Dublin residents operated by An Garda Síochána will also close temporarily, to allow for revised public health guidance to be issued.

Any permission that was renewed by the notices of 20th March 2020, 13th May 2020 and 16th July 2020 which therefore has a new expiry date between 20th August 2020 and 20th September 2020 is automatically renewed for a further 1 month.

### Travel

#### **I don’t need to register until I have been in the State for 90 days – what if I want to travel and return to Ireland before I register and receive my IRP card?**

If you know that you will be travelling within the first four months of your arrival in Ireland, you
should apply for a multiple entry visa for your initial trip to Ireland. This will enable you to travel in
and out of Ireland before you register and receive your IRP card.

If you travelled to Ireland on a single entry visa and discover that you need to travel and return to
Ireland before you get your IRP card, you can travel and apply for another entry visa from outside Ireland.

#### **I have registered for IRP but haven't received my card yet. What if I want to travel and return to Ireland before I receive my IRP card?**

The Irish Residence Permit is issued to non-EEA nationals who have permission to reside in the State for more than 90 days. 

It can take some weeks to get a registration appointment, and up to 2 weeks for an IRP card to be produced following registration. 

Visa required nationals who intend to travel in and out of Ireland during the first four months of their planned stay should apply for a multiple entry visa, which will allow them to travel into Ireland multiple times in a given period before their IRP card is issued.
