Pros:

- Good work culture

- Irish are very welcoming and friendly

- Less pollution

- Better pay (**doesn't apply if you are already earning high in India)

- Free education from a certain age - teaching style is different - science projects, book reading etc.

- Eligible for citizenship in 5 years

- No corruption at lower level (brown envelope exists at higher level)

- Rarely water problems/flooding

- No power blackouts (** but there are indications this could happen in future due to big data centres running here)

Cons:

- Rising costs - home prices, rental, electricity, gas

- High car insurance for newcomers

- Getting a driver's licence takes more time and costs a lot due to mandatory EDT lessons, rules, etc.

- Poor healthcare access - gp's charge 60 euro and spend 5 mins with you, hospital appointments have more waiting time - be it for scan/diagnosis/operation

- High dental costs

- Poor public transport connectivity/timetable

- Less food varieties

- Shops/Malls close early

- Not much sun - need to take vitamin D tablets - gloomy weather doesn't help

- Immigration processes slow/painful (** seeing some improvements lately here)

- Some teenagers get spoilt/no manners/drugs etc
