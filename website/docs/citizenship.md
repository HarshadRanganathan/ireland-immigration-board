## 6-weeks rule

A reasonable and generous period of up to 6
weeks is allowed to provide for absences from the State for normal holidays
and other short term and temporary nature absences, such as for a family
bereavement. 

The onus is on the applicant to ensure that their registration
with GNIB is kept up to date. 

Absences of more than  6  weeks in any year
need to be listed and a brief note explaining the reason for each absence
need to be submitted your application for naturalisation. Absences
totalling 6 weeks or more in any year will be deducted in their entirety
from your reckonable residence in the State.

If you were out of the country for work purposes for a period longer than 6
weeks, please forward a copy of your P60â€™s for each year of residence
claimed along with a letter from your employer stating the dates you were
abroad for work purposes to support your application.

Each case is examined on its own merits and submitted to the Minister for
decision. Please be advised that a determination on whether an applicant
satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be
made after an application is received.

## Temporary Extensions

#### Can we add the temporary extensions provided by Minister Of Justice during Covid period in the residency calculator to fill any gaps in IRP?

Please be advised you may add the temporary
permission to remain extensions onto the residency calculator

## Passport Expiry

#### I have applied for naturalisation and awaiting decision. Meanwhile my passport is going to expire. Can I renew my passport? Will it affect my application? Should I submit a new application if I get a new renewed passport?

Please  note  we  base your application on the passport that was in date at
the time you submitted your application.

Please  note  we  may  need a copy of your updated passport if it associate
with  your declaration of fidelity at a later stage in your application -if
your solicitor uses it for verification purposes.
