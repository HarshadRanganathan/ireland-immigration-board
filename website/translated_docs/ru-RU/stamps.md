## Stamp 1

#### **I'm currently on CSEP. Can I change my job or employer?**

While the job offer must be of 2 years’ duration, the foreign national is expected to stay with the initial employer for a **minimum period of 12 months**.

A new employment permit (for a different employer) cannot be considered if less than 12 months has elapsed since the permit holder first commenced employment in the State pursuant to an employment permit.

However, where the following circumstances apply, the Department **may permit a Critical Skills Employment holder to change employer**:

* Holder is made redundant;
* Circumstances (unforeseen at time of application) arise that fundamentally change the employment relationship.
