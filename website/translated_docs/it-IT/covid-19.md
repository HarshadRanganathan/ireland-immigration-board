## Emirates

#### **Do we need a negative COVID-19 PCR test report if we are travelling to Ireland by Emirates?**

All passengers arriving in Dubai from any destination, including passengers connecting in Dubai, must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate to be accepted on the flight.

We recommend you bring a printed certificate, but digital ones are accepted in Dubai. It must be an official certificate - SMS confirmation messages are not accepted.

The test must be taken a maximum of 96 hours before departure. This excludes children under the age of 12 and passengers who have a moderate or severe disability.
