It is mandatory to have a COVID-19 PCR test before you fly with Etihad Airways – you will only be permitted to fly if you have a negative test result.

Your test must be carried out a maximum of 96 hours before your flight departure time at any government accredited medical facility.

Children under 12 and people with mild and severe disabilities are exempt from COVID-19 PCR testing. This may vary by destination – always check before you fly.

Wearing a mouth-nose-cover on board and at the airport is mandatory for everyone.

We only accept an exception from the obligation to wear a mask on presentation of a validated negative PCR test result and a medical certificate on the corresponding Lufthansa Group form.

The test result must not be older than 48 hours prior to the start of the respective outbound and return flight.
